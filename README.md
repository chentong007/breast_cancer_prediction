# breast_cancer_prediction

Introduction:

I don't have permission to expose raw dataset, but I can show the result as running this program

This program evaluates info among various aspects of patients and make prediction for treatment
(binary classification on whether the patient has breast cancer)

Accuracy rate is not ideal, I'm still working on reduce the problem of overfitting

As shown in results: 0.9354(training) compare to 0.9438(test), result prefers to testing.
